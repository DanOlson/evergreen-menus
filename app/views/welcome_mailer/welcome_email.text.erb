Time to kick the tires!

We're glad to have you on board! You've just taken an impactful step toward an easier and more accurate menu management experience. We want to make sure you get the most out of your investment, so we've put together some tips to help get you up and running right away.

When you login to your account, there are three basic steps you'll need to take to get started with Evergreen Menus:

1) Create an Establishment
2) Create some Lists
3) Make Menus from your Lists

Lists belong to Menus, and Menus belong to Establishments. Let's take each step in a little more detail:

Create an Establishment:
The first thing you'll want to do is create an establishment for each bar or restaurant you're adding to Evergreen. For example, you might create an establishment called Betty's Diner. Then, you could add the various menu items you serve at Betty's Diner. That brings us to step 2:


Create Lists:
Lists are groups of menu items. You might have an Appetizers list, a Salads list, a Pasta list, etc. Combining these lists, you create Menus.


Make Menus:
Now that you have some lists, you can combine them to create Menus. Menus come in a few different varieties: print menus, web menus, and digital display menus. With print menus, you can design and format your lists for printing and distribution in-house. Web menus allow you present lists directly on your existing website, offering instant updates whenever you make changes in Evergreen. Digital display menus are optimized for display on HDTVs within your establishment, and rotate through lists of your choosing on an interval. Perfect for showcasing specials or other featured content.


Google My Business:
If you already have a Google My Business listing for your establishment, and your Evergreen Menus plan includes Google My Business integration, much of the above can be completely automated! Evergreen can use the menu content you've already added to your Google My Business listing in order to create establishments and lists. Simply enable the Google My Business integration from your account dashboard, and you're off to the races.
