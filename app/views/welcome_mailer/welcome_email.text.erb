Welcome to Evergreen Menus!

We're glad to have you on board! You've just taken an impactful step toward an easier and more accurate menu management experience. We want to make sure you get the most out of your investment, so we've put together some tips to help get you up and running right away.

Once you've added your first establishment, add a list. Or three. Or ten!

Lists are the foundational building blocks of Evergreen Menus. They are groups of menu items that you would want to appear together on one of your menus. You might have a list for Appetizers, one for Entrees, and one for Desserts. Once you have a few lists, you can really unlock the value of Evergreen Menus.

Thank you for choosing Evergreen Menus! We want this to be the beginning of a long and satisfying relationship, so if you have any questions or need help getting set up, please don't hesitate to reach out. Just respond to this email or send us a new one at admin@evergreenmenus.com, and we'll get back to you right away. Thank you for your business.

Best,
Dan Olson, Founder and CEO
